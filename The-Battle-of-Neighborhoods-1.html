<p>Imagine that you want to open most successful busuness ever been. As an Example, you want to open a student cafe network. In the near future, this set cafe is expected to be the most popular and best-known in the world. But today, you have limited amount of money, so it seems to be enough only for one cafe opening. The problem we aim to solve is to analyze good locations in the major Russian cities the best places to open our first cafe. In this case, we expect to return invested money quickly. Our main target are students who learn in top Russian cities.</p>

<p>We will use the FourSquare API to collect data about locations of 1.Russian colleges and Universities and 2.Popular Cafes in 6 major Russian cities which are: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Nizny Novgorod. These are one of the most populated Russian cities and we can hope that they have many colleges and cafes. We try to examine the Cafe/College density for each city and then we check such colleges that haven't popular cafes in 10 minutes walk. If wa cluster such places, then we conclude that the largest cluster could be the best place to open our first Cafe. Let's check it a week later!</p>
